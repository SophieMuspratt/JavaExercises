# JavaExercises

Requirements:
Write a method that will take a single list of numbers in any form (Integer, Double, BigDecimal or String) and return the value of the combined total as a BigDecimal.
Start simple and expand the method as you increase the test coverage.

Tips:
Consider how you want to handle an empty list, null objects, unexpected objects or parse exceptions.

That is all youâ€™re getting!
